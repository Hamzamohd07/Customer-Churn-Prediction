## Customer Churn Prediction
Built a predictive model that identifies customers who are likely to churn, allowing businesses to take proactive measures to retain them


**Data Preprocessing:**

Clean and encode the dataset, scale features, and select relevant attributes.

**Model Design:**

- *Input Layer:* Features as input neurons.
- *Hidden Layers:* Dense layers with ReLU activation.
- *Output Layer:* Single neuron with sigmoid activation.

**Training:** 
- Split data into training and test sets.
- Use binary cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer.
- Apply dropout for regularization.

**Evaluation:**  
- *Metrics:* Accuracy to determine model perfomance.

**Tools:**  
- *Language:* Python
- *Libraries:* TensorFlow/Keras, Pandas, NumPy.
